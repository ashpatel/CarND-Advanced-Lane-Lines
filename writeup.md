**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

The project is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook file `AdvanceLaneFindingProject.ipynb`. The Code cells are referenced in this writeup are identified with a comment in the first line of each cell.

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

In "# Code Cell 2" is the `CalibrateCamera` class that provides the functionality to read in the calibration images and calculate the parameters for correcting images from the camera.

On initializing the `CalibrateCamera` class, the images in the camera_cal folder are read in and then using `cv2.findChessBoardCorners` on each images we build up the objpoints and imgpoints arrays. Once initialized, you can use the `undistortImage()` method to output a corrected image.
Internally the class calls `cv2.calibrateCamera` and stores the parameters returned for later use.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./examples/example.ipynb" (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).  

The images below show the first calibration image (chessboard), and then the undistorted chessboard generated by the `undistortImage()` method.

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

In "#Code Cell 5" I apply read in one of the test images and apply the CalibrateCamera.undistortImage(). The original and undistorted images are shown below:

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

In "#Code Cell 6" I created a class `ImageChannel()` which lets me take an image and ask for specific channels for that image. eg; asking for "RGB_R" would return the Red channel from an RGB image and HLS_L would yield the L channel from a HLS image. The input is always a RGB image.

This allowed me to generalize the `abs_sobel_thresh()`, `dir_threshold()`, `mag_thresh()` and `color_tresh()` functions (also in same code cell) so that I could experiment with gradients and color transforms on different channnels to figure out ideal ones to use with my pipeline. These functions were derived from those created in Lesson 17.

In "#Code cell 7" we read in a test image and then calculate various gradients and color transforms, leveraging different directions (x & y) and different channels to visualize how they work.

The first 6 images below are leveraging the GRAY channel and the second set are leveraging the HLS colorspace.

![alt text][hls_examples]

In "Code Cell 8" I then created the main `pipeline()` function that creates a combined thresholded image that leverages the various threshold & gradient functions. I experimented with various combinations (The commented out lines are various experiments) and eventually settled on the following;

```python
combined_binary[((gradx_g == 1) & (grady_g == 1) | (gradx_gr == 1)) | ((color_s == 1) | (color_l == 1) | (color_gr == 1)) & ((mag_binary == 1) & (dir_binary == 1))] = 1
```
The visualization of the original image transformed into the binary threshold image is shown below;

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

To perform the perspective transform, I first had to figure out the src and dst points for the transform. In "Code Cell #8a" I drew the src points on the original image of a road with straight lines (in the test_images) and then performed a transform and visualized the dst points on the resulting image. I verified that the resulting warped image had parallel lines for the lanes. The below image shows that result;

![alt text][warped_straight_lines]

The src & dst points I settled on are;

```python
    src = np.float32(
        [[685, 450],
          [1090, 710],
          [220, 710],
          [595, 450]])

    dst = np.float32(
        [[900, 0],
          [900, 710],
          [250, 710],
          [250, 0]])
```

In "#Code Cell 9" I then created `get_transform_matrix()` function that leveraged these co-ordinates for src and dst to provide the transformation and inverse transformation matrices as output.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

In "#Code Cell 12" I implement the main logic for identifying the lane-line pixels. I encapsulated in the class `SlidingWindow()`, defined from line 67 onwards, the logic for the sliding window from Lesson 18.
The main method is `polyfit()` with either calls `sliding_window_polyfit()` or `no_sliding_polyfit()` depending on wheter a line has already been detected. State is stored in the `Lane()` class, including a history of previous polynomials lines, so that we can leverage the average when drawing the lanes.

In "#Code Cell 13", we do a test of the `SlidingWindow()` class the visualize the output of the lane finding algorithm. The first two images are from calling `sliding_window_polyfit()` and the second two are from calling `no_sliding_polyfit()` which does a more optimized search around the previously found lines.

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

In "#Code Cell 12" the method `calc_curve()` at lines 80-96 calculates the curve of the left and right lines. The method `calc_lane_position()` at lines 75-79, calculates the position of the car within the lane.


#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

In "#Code Cell 12" the method `drawLane()` at lines 330-357 draws the lane and superimposes it upon the original image. The method `drawData()` ouputs the curve and position data on the final image.

The below image shows an example the final image thru the whole pipeline process.

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./test_videos_output/project_video.mp4)

---

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  

The main area of problems I faced were in lanes where the lighting conditions or the color of the road becomes lighter so that the lane on the left didn't have good contrast to detect. I experimented with using different channels of videos. I ended up with a workable solution for the file project_video.mp4, but still not a great solution for the file challenge_video.mp4. I need to experiment with additional colorspaces, channels, gradients and thresholds to come up with a more fault tolerant solution.
